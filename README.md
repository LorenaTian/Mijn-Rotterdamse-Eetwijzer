# Mijn Rotterdamse Eetwijzer  
*A data-driven food guide by Lorena (Lingyan Tian)*  

Because sometimes the hardest question in life is:  
> “Where should we eat?” 🍜  

So instead of endlessly scrolling through Google Maps, I built my own dataset — 29 restaurants across Rotterdam, and turned it into a mini analytics project. 
The goal: find out which meals brought the most happiness "per euro spent".

## 🍽️ What’s Cooking in the Data

Each restaurant includes:
- Cuisine type, postcode, average spend (after splitting the bill 😅)
- My own taste, environment, and service ratings
- Public Google Maps ratings
- Location data for a Rotterdam food map 
- My comments as recommendations
  
---

## 📊 Highlights
- **Avg. spend:** €23.45 per person  
- **Avg. rating (me):** 4.09 → stricter critic than Google (4.48)  
- **Correlation (spend vs rating):** 0.305 → a little more money, a little more joy  
- **Best zone:** Under €20 = unbeatable ROI (Return on Ingestion)

## 🌟 Top Value-for-Money Winners

🥇 **Mario Shawarma Restaurant** – Delicious, affordable, unbeatable ROI (Return on Ingestion).  
🥈 **Yellow River Lanzhou Handpulled Noodles** – Handmade noodles, small price, big joy.  
🥉 **Restaurant Baskent** – Flavor overload at €17.50.  

💬 *Mid-priced spots offered solid satisfaction, but the cheap eats clearly won the data-driven food war.*

## ❤️ Why I Built This
I wanted to combine two things I love — **food and data** — into something both personal and analytical.  
This project shows that data analysis doesn’t always need to be corporate or cold; sometimes it just tells you where to find the best noodles in town. 🍜
